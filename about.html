                <p>Hi! I’m so glad you’re here and want to know a little more about me. <br>Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</p>
                <div class="dark">
                   <p>I’m mom of Vlad, a 2 years boy. I’m 27 years. I’m married and I’m on maternity leave.<br>This is a brief introduction of myself. If you are interested in knowing more, read my articles or take a look at my pictures.</p>

                    <p>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. <br>I like to read, I like to write; <br> I like to think, I like to dream; <br> I like to talk, I like to listen. <br> I like to see the sunrise in the morning, <br> I like to see the moonlight at night; <br>I like the land and the nature, <br>I like people. </p>
